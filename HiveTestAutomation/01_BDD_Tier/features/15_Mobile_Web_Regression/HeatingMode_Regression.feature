Feature: Validate the various mode change for Central Heating end point in the Boiler Module

  @C265092 @HeatMode @Android_Regression @Android_SmokeTest @iOS_Regression
  Scenario Outline: SC-CH-MC01_Validate the Mode change for Central Heating
    Given The Hive product is paired and setup for Central Heating with API Validation
     When Mode is automatically changed to OFF on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as OFF with Target Temperature as 1.0
    When Target Temperature is automatically set to 20.0 on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as MANUAL with Target Temperature as 20.0
    When Mode is automatically changed to MANUAL on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as MANUAL with Target Temperature as 20.0
    When Mode is automatically changed to BOOST with Target Temperature as 22.0 for a duration of 1 hour on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as BOOST with Target Temperature as 22.0
    When Mode is automatically changed to OFF on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as OFF with Target Temperature as 1.0
    When Mode is automatically changed to MANUAL on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as MANUAL with Target Temperature as 20.0
    When Target Temperature is automatically set to <FirstSetTemperature> on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as MANUAL with Target Temperature as <FirstSetTemperature>
    When Mode is automatically changed to BOOST with Target Temperature as 22.0 for a duration of 1 hour on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as BOOST with Target Temperature as 22.0
    When Mode is automatically changed to OFF on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as OFF with Target Temperature as 1.0

    Examples:
      | FirstSetTemperature |
      | 27.0                |

    When Mode is automatically changed to OFF on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as OFF with Target Temperature as 1.0
    When Mode is automatically changed to AUTO on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as AUTO with Current Target Temperature
    When Mode is automatically changed to OFF on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as OFF with Target Temperature as 1.0
    When Mode is automatically changed to BOOST with Target Temperature as <Boost Temperature> for a duration of 1 hour on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as BOOST with Target Temperature as <Boost Temperature>
    When Mode is automatically changed to OFF on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as OFF with Target Temperature as 1.0
    When Target Temperature is automatically set to 7.0 on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as MANUAL with Target Temperature as 7.0

    Examples:
      | Boost Temperature |
      | 27.0              |

  Scenario Outline: SC-CH-MC04_Validate the Mode change for Central Heating
    Given The Hive product is paired and setup for Central Heating with API Validation
    When Mode is automatically changed to AUTO on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as AUTO with Current Target Temperature
    When Target Temperature is automatically set to <AutoOverRideTemperature> on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as OVERRIDE with Target Temperature as <AutoOverRideTemperature>
    When Mode is automatically changed to MANUAL on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as MANUAL with Target Temperature as 20.0
    When Mode is automatically changed to AUTO on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as AUTO with Current Target Temperature
    When Target Temperature is automatically set to <AutoOverRideTemperature> on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as OVERRIDE with Target Temperature as <AutoOverRideTemperature>
    When Mode is automatically changed to BOOST with Target Temperature as <Boost Temperature> for a duration of 1 hour on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as BOOST with Target Temperature as <Boost Temperature>

    Then Automatically validate current mode as OVERRIDE with Target Temperature as <AutoOverRideTemperature>
    When Mode is automatically changed to OFF on the Client
    Then Automatically validate current mode as OFF with Target Temperature as 1.0

    Examples:
      | AutoOverRideTemperature | Boost Temperature |
      | 12.0                    | 27.0              |
